# This is a parody and should not be taken seriously. Please use [https://github.com/flameaway/RemoveConfidential/](https://github.com/flameaway/RemoveConfidential/) for the real tweak. I do not own any tweak related code in this repository.
## This does have some use though, you can fork this and change `Tweak.x` to have a custom different text and my workflow `.yml` will compile it under Releases. This just removes the dependancy of cloning and building and installing theos yourself (without any version numbers in the `.deb` too so the `.deb` link stays consistent)

This text is different than the custom footnote you can set with something like Misaka (this lets you basically have a SECOND message). I don't know if this will work on other tools that enable SpringBoard injection (that dont have the confidentiality message show up), I just know it works on Serotonin since the legal text is guaranteed to show up.
